    "description": "The database presents the results of the latest revision of the diversity of vascular plants in Slovakia in the form of an overview of their accepted names and synonyms, in accordance with the valid international code of botanical nomenclature (<1>Turland et al. 2018</1>). It includes all families, genera, species and infraspecific taxa that have been recorded in the territory of the Slovak Republic so far. In addition to spontaneous, native and non-native taxa, it also provides an overview of more frequently cultivated species. The web version of this reference checklist allows it to be continuously updated. It takes into account the most recent taxonomic, chorologic and nomenclatoric studies and also presents the Slovak national nomenclature of the vascular plants, revised and approved by the Nomenclature Commission of <4>the Slovak Botanical Society at the Slovak Academy of Sciences</4> with the application of the latest principles (<7>Kliment et al. 2017</7>). In addition to the correct scientific and national names and their synonyms, each taxon is also associated with information on its origin and invasion status (<9>Medvecká et al. 2012</9>), endemism (<11>Kliment 1999</11>, <14>Kliment et al. 2016</14>), red-list category of threat (<16>Eliáš et al. 2015</16>) and legislative protection (<18>Vyhláška 24/2003</18>).",
